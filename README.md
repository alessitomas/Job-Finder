## Project Overview


**CV Tailor** is an innovative tool designed to assist job seekers in tailoring their resumes for specific job positions. By analyzing the job description and comparing it to the user's uploaded resume, the system provides personalized feedback to enhance the resume's alignment with the job requirements. This tool goes beyond generic resume improvement tips, focusing instead on providing actionable, role-specific insights, particularly helpful for career changers or those applying for niche roles.


### Features:
1. **Upload Resume (PDF)**: Users can upload their resume in PDF format.
2. **Job-Specific Feedback**: Enter the desired job position, and the system evaluates the resume against the job requirements.
3. **Detailed Feedback**: The tool highlights:
   - **Strengths**: Points in the resume that align well with the job requirements.
   - **Weaknesses**: Missing or underrepresented skills and experiences.
   - **Suggestions**: Specific recommendations for improvement.
4. **Score & Suggestions**: Provides a score (0-10) based on the resume's alignment with the job, along with actionable tips to enhance it.
5. **Deployed on Streamlit**: Easy-to-use interface accessible online.

## Problem Statement

Finding a job can be challenging, particularly when transitioning between career fields. Current resume-building tools focus primarily on formatting or offer generic advice that lacks specificity for a particular role or industry. **CV Tailor** addresses this gap by providing:
- Tailored recommendations based on job-specific keywords and requirements.
- Insights for career changers to adapt their existing skills to new roles.
- Measurable impact by directly improving the likelihood of resume shortlisting.

## Research on Existing Solutions (Part A)

### Findings:
- **Generic Resume Builders**: Tools like Zety and Novoresume focus on layout and formatting rather than personalized job fit.
- **Limited Career Change Support**: No widely available tools specifically help candidates transition between industries or fields.

**Conclusion**: There is a significant gap in tools offering personalized, job-specific resume feedback with an emphasis on career transitions.

This suggests that a notable portion of users encountered issues with the tool's accuracy, which could impact trust. Improving the toolâ€™s ability to provide reliable and fact-based responses should be a priority to enhance user confidence.
